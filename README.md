The pomodoro technique is a time-management method that I use to increase productivity every time I am studying or working on projects.\
Since I always search up pomodoro timers on Youtube, I decided to make my own using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\
\
This is how it works:
1. Pick a task you want to focus on.
2. Work for 25 minutes straight.
3. When the timer sounds, take a 5 minute break.
4. Repeat.
5. After four 25 minute sessions, take a 15 minute break.
